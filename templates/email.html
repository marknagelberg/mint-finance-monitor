        <div class="all-time">
            <h2>All-Time Performance (since starting Mint)</h2>
            Total income: {{all_time_after_tax_income | currency_filter}}

            Total spending: {{all_time_spending | currency_filter}}

            Savings rate: {{all_time_savings_rate | percentage_filter}}

            <br>
            At this savings rate, we become financially independent after
            {{all_time_savings_rate | years_to_fi_filter}} total working years ({{ (all_time_savings_rate | years_to_fi_filter) - (annual_savings_trend[-1][0] - year_work_began)}} remaining years of work)!

            Current net worth: {{current_net_worth | currency_filter}}

            <br>
            If we retire now, we could safely withdraw {{current_safe_withdrawal_amount | currency_filter}}
            each year from our savings.

            <br>
            Approximate amount of net worth we need to be financially independent,
            given our overall average spending and savings levels:

            Total income: {{last_month_after_tax_income | currency_filter}}

            Total spending: {{last_month_spending | currency_filter}}

            <br>
            Savings rate: {{last_month_savings_rate | percentage_filter}}

            <br>
            If we have this savings rate all the time, we become financially independent after

            <br>
            Approximate amount of net worth we would need to be financially independent,
            assuming we continue spending the same amount as last month: 
            {{last_month_net_worth_required_for_fi | currency_filter}}
